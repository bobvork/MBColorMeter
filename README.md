_Disclaimer: This is my first github repos, so I'm still getting used to this. I spent about an hour putting together this little project, most of which I spent looking up how to to certain things on StackOverflow. It will get better._

# MBColorMeter

Menu Bar Color Meter is a small app for Mac OS X that sits in your menu bar and displays the color that is currently under your mouse cursor. At the moment, that's all it does. 
Planned features include:

* Different color spaces
* Editable global hot keys to hold the current color
* copy the current color to the clipboard in HEX and a couple of other formats
* â€¦Anything I think of along the way =)

MBColorMeter makes up for the functionality the built-in 'DigitalColor Meter' app in OS X lost. It doesn't display colors in hex values anymore, and it won't stay on top of other windows.
